## Work in progress

Robodt is still in some heavy development, it's currently released as beta. You can safely use it for live websites. But most features, packages, distributions and documentation are just not complete yet. API changes can also happen in future releases.

Don't let it stop you from trying, if you have any feedback please let me know on [Twitter](//twitter.com/slurfhondje)!

## Requirements

The only thing you need is a webserver like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [IIS](http://www.iis.net/) or [NGINX](http://nginx.org/) with [PHP](http://php.net/) support, version 5.3.0 or newer. Easy setups are also available, [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows or [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) for OS X. You can check this by making a PHP-file with the following contents:

&lt;?php print PHP_VERSION;

When installing through Composer you also need to check your command-line version of php. You can do this by executing the following: php -v


## Choose a distribution

There will be several pre-build distributions, so you can pick the one most suited for you or even build your own. **On the moment it's just the light edition**. If you wan't to know more, there is a list of packages and distributions that will be available in the future on [the documentation](/documentation) page.


### Robodt Light Edition

Fastest and most lightweight option available. The only thing it does is handling requests and content. There is no admin panel of any kind. Packages used:

- robodt/robodt: Robodt Core
