### Found a bug?

It's open source (and beta) software, if you would like to report it on our [Github](https://github.com/robodt/robodt/issues) page, that would be nice! Of course you can also make a pull request if you want to help out.

### Keep up to date

You can find me on Twitter: [@slurfhondje](//twitter.com/slurfhondje). An e-mail newsletter is coming soon.
